Project: Hangman


Files are a great way to save and reload a game, so we’ll give it a shot here by building Hangman.

Assignment


You will be building a simple command line Hangman game where one player plays against the computer, but a bit more advanced. If you’re unfamiliar with how Hangman works, see Wikipedia.
